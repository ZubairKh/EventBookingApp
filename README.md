## Event booking app
Learning project to use GraphQL with Node js and React js
This project is a simple event app where users can create, read, update and delete events.
The app uses GraphQL as the API layer, Node js as the server and React js as the client

The project is divided into three main parts:
1. Server (Node js)
2. API (GraphQL)
3. Client (React js)

### Server (Node js)
The server is built using Node js and Express js. It uses the `graphql` package to create
the GraphQL schema and the `graphql-http` package to create the GraphQL server.

### Events
The events are stored in a simple in-memory data store. In a real-world application, you would use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
